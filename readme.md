# **sspc**: Skyward Sword Practice Codes

This is the source code for [Skyward Sword Practice Codes](https://shoutplenty.uk/ss/pc). At its core, the project is written in Gecko for the cheat engine used by GameCube/Wii emulators/loaders, with some snippets written in the assembly (ASM) language of those systems. However, a [higher-level language](https://github.com/Pyorot/gecko-compiler) developed by [bob-zsr](https://github.com/bob-zsr) is used to aid the coding.

## Release
The codes themselves and all help material are published at <https://shoutplenty.uk/ss/pc>.

*(If this domain expires, there's also <https://shoutplenty.netlify.app/ss/pc>.)*

## Collab
I hope this becomes a more collaborative project. I'll review pull requests and discuss works on the [Skyward Sword discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/fa5kpVa). I've done my best to document things in comments and in the docs folder, so jump in :P.

## Dependencies
The project depends on [Bob's Gecko compiler](https://github.com/Pyorot/gecko-compiler), which is currently a WIP. The modded version linked above will always work and be updated in tandem with this repo. The compiler repo should be extracted into a folder called `/compiler`. It depends on [pyiiasmh](https://code.google.com/archive/p/pyiiasmh/), an ASM encoder, required only to build ASM codes; it should be extracted into a folder called `/pyiiasmh`. This itself requires Python 2 to be installed.

## Compiler
To run the compiler, run the command `python compiler/main.py` from this repo's root folder. Add a word (after a space) to the command with the letters a,d,g (e.g. `adg`) to specify what to compile:
* **a**: build the ASM codes (into `build-asm`);
* **d**: build the result into Dolphin .ini format;
* **g**: build the result into .gct format for console game loaders.

It defaults to `dg` if no such word is added.

The compiler builds all codes present in `/src`, resolving all references to ASM files in `/build-asm` (which may be stale if `a` is not specified), with results stored in `/build`. The Gecko syntax it accepts is specified in the readme of its [repo](https://github.com/bob-zsr), and is not standardised/versioned *yet*.

## Directories
| | |
|-|-| 
| **build** | (generated by compiler). Stores resultant Gecko codes.
| **build-asm** | (generated by compiler). Stores generated ASM codes for inclusion.  
| **compiler** | (provided by user). Compiler used to build the project (into the `build` folder).  
| **demo** | examples not built by the project.  
| **docs** | project documentation.  
| **pyiiasmh** | (provided by user). Asm encoder used by assemble.sh.  
| **src** | all Gecko codes to be built.  
| **src-asm** | all ASM codes to be built and referenced by Gecko codes.

[Bob-zsr](https://github.com/bob-zsr) for his amazing Gecko compiler, which will hopefully be the cornerstone of many a successful Gecko codes project once it's finished.

Plus the whole Skyward Sword community for abridging info on memory locations ([1](https://tiny.cc/skywardswordsceneflags) [2](https://tiny.cc/skywardswordstoryflags) [3](https://tiny.cc/skywardswordtempflags) [4](https://tiny.cc/skywardswordinventoryflag) [5](https://github.com/Antidote/skyward-sword-save-editor/)), and MrCheeze in particular for [reversing the cutscene scripting system](https://github.com/MrCheeze/skywardsword-tools).
