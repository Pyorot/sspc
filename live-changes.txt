changes since v1.1:
1. spawn: store/load now includes room
2. spawn: "scratch test" â€“ invalid locations no longer corrupt spawn data during blocked reloads
3. spawn: rewrote BiT reload default values in Gecko (used to be asm)
4. cutscene: ported to new compiler (now requires triple sums)
5. cutscene: 29 skips selected for itemless, some new, many removed (fixed machi and gorko)
