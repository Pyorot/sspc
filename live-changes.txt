changes since v1.1:
1. spawn: store/load now includes room
2. spawn: "scratch test" â€“ invalid locations no longer corrupt spawn data during blocked reloads
3. under-the-hood: rewrote BiT reload default values in Gecko (used to be asm)
4. under-the-hood: ported everything to new compiler
5. cutscene: 29 skips selected for itemless, some new, many removed (fixed machi and gorko)
6. context: while enabled, entering Temple in BiT sets flags to trigger harp tutorial
7. cutscene: moved button combo from up to C+up to avoid interfering with harp
